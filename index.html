        /*Understand The Problem:
            This script will allow a user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against
            the computer.  The user will choose one of the above whilst the computer
            will randomly choose as well.  When the player has chosen Rock, Paper, or 
            Scissors, the user will press "GO!" to indicate that they are done
            choosing and is ready to play.  Both the user's choice and computer's
            choice will be revealed at the same time and the winner will be determined. */

        /*Plan:
            User Interface: Using console in Chrome Devtools
            Input Data: User will input choice into a textbox
            Desired Output: User input data vs. Computer input data = win/lose for user
            Output Y = User input vs. Computer input */

            User inputs a choice into a textbox: Rock, Paper, or Scissors
            User clicks on a button that says "Play" to start game.  
                But returns "You forgot to choose" if Rock, Paper, or Scissors is not written*/
